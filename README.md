# Unnamedlinuxdistro
for artists, WIP, roadmap only

## Version Naming
I will have a version method to account for incremental updates(example Ver0.1)
Every increment on the left side of decimal will have a new fancy name(Example Ver1.0 Named Something New)

## Roadmap(no order)
1. Wine already set up with a fancy launcher(will take a while)
2. commonly used creative apps preinstalled(with lite build not containing them)
3. PopOS fork
4. Wikis to teach to visually and functionally customize and also debug known problems  
5. fancy landscape wallpaper/lockscreens
6. fancy neofetch designs and OS name
